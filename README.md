# FinEAS: Financial Embedding Analysis of Sentiment üìà
(SentenceBERT for Financial News Sentiment Regression)

This repository contains the code for generating three models for Finance News Sentiment Analysis.

The models implemented are:
- A SentenceBERT with simple classifier.
- A BERT with simple classifier.
- A simple Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network.
- FinBERT from HuggingFace.
- SentenceBERT from HuggingFace

## Results ‚úÖ
We used three partitions of the datasets from the February 11th, 2021. 6 months previous to that date,
1 year previous to that date and 2 years previous to the date mentioned.

We also evaluated the models 2 weeks later that date; that is to say, we evaluated from February 12th, 2021
to February 26th, 2021.

The table below shows the results:

|                          | FinEAS | BERT   | BiLSTM |
|--------------------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| 6 months                 |   **0.0556** | 0.2124 | 0.2108 |
| 6 months<br>Next 2 weeks |   **0.1061** | 0.2190 | 0.2194 |
| 1 year                   |   **0.0654** | 0.2137 | 0.2140 |
| 1 year<br>Next 2 weeks   |   **0.1058** | 0.2191 | 0.2194 |
| 2 years                  |   **0.0671** | 0.2087 | 0.2086 |
| 2 years<br>Next 2 weeks  |   **0.1065** | 0.2188 | 0.2185 |


The table below shows the results for the HuggingFace models
| Dates     | FinEAS | FinBERT |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 6 months  | 0.0044 | 0.0050  |
| 12 months | 0.0036 | 0.0034  |
| 24 months | 0.0033 | 0.0040  |
